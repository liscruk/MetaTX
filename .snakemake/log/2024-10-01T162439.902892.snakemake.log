MissingOutputException in rule mapHuman in file /Users/chris/Work/Pipelines/MetaTX/workflow/snakefile, line 29:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
/Users/chris/Work/Projects/Collab_Gina/analysis/bam/S2_3h.hg.stat.tsv (missing locally, parent dir contents: S2_3h.xn.bam, S2_3h.hg.bam, S4_5h.xn.bam, S3_5h.hg.bam, S4_5h.hg.bam, S3_5h.xn.bam)
Removing output files of failed job mapHuman since they might be corrupted:
/Users/chris/Work/Projects/Collab_Gina/analysis/bam/S2_3h.hg.bam
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
