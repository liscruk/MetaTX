MissingOutputException in rule mapXeno in file /Users/chris/Work/Pipelines/MetaTX/workflow/snakefile, line 50:
Job 5  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
/Users/chris/Work/Projects/Collab_Gina/analysis/bam/S3_5h.xn.stat.tsv (missing locally, parent dir contents: S3_5h.xn.bam)
Removing output files of failed job mapXeno since they might be corrupted:
/Users/chris/Work/Projects/Collab_Gina/analysis/bam/S3_5h.xn.bam
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
